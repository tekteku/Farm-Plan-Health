## Demo Script

### Part 1: Performance Dashboard (2 minutes)

**Step 1** - Show the Header
> "Notice the Farm Health Score chip in the header - it shows 87/100"

**Step 2** - Click to Expand
> "Let me click on it to reveal the full performance dashboard..."

**Step 3** - Highlight Key Metrics
Point to each section:
- **Overall Score**: "This is calculated from health trends, response time, and prevention rates"
- **ROI Metrics**: "The system shows tangible value - $243 saved, 18% yield increase, 5.5 hours saved per week"
- **Badges**: "Farmers earn achievement badges for milestones. See the 'Green Thumb' badge? That's earned by maintaining 90%+ health for 30 days. Some badges show progress - like Documenter at 76%"

**Step 4** - Explain the Value
> "This gamification layer transforms farm monitoring from a chore into an engaging experience. Studies show this approach can increase user retention by 40-60%."

---

### Part 2: Health Timeline (2 minutes)

**Step 1** - Open Plant Detail
> "Let me click on any plant to see its detail page..."

**Step 2** - Switch to Timeline Tab
> "Notice the two tabs - Overview and Health Timeline. Let me show you the timeline..."

**Step 3** - Use the Scrubber
> "This timeline scrubber lets you rewind through the plant's health history. See how it was at 40% health on October 15th..."

**Step 4** - Show Progress
> "By October 27th, after treatment with nitrogen fertilizer, it recovered to 90%. That's a 50-point improvement over 12 days."

**Step 5** - Enable Compare Mode
> "The Compare Photos feature lets you see before-and-after side by side..."
(Click "Compare Photos" chip)

**Step 6** - Demonstrate Value
> "This solves a real problem - farmers can prove to supply chain partners exactly how they grew their crops and document recovery from issues."

### Part 3: Wrap-up (1 minute)

**Technical Highlights:**
> "From a technical standpoint, these features demonstrate:
> - Complex state management with React hooks
> - TypeScript interfaces for type safety
> - Material-UI component composition
> - Mock API design with realistic data generation
> - Product thinking around user engagement"

**Business Impact:**
> "But beyond the code, this shows I think about user behavior and business metrics. The performance dashboard increases engagement, and the timeline provides accountability - both critical for a SaaS platform's success."

## Quick Feature Access

### To See Performance Dashboard:
1. Click the "Score: 87/100" chip in the header
2. Scroll through badges
3. Click "Hide" when done

### To See Health Timeline:
1. Click any plant row in the Plant Inventory table
   - Unhealthy plants open AI Diagnosis
   - Healthy plants open Detail modal
2. Click "Health Timeline" tab
3. Use the slider to scrub through time
4. Click "Compare Photos" to see before/after
5. Use both sliders to compare different dates

## Key Talking Points

### When They Ask: "What was challenging?"

**For Performance Dashboard:**
> "Designing a scoring algorithm that felt fair and motivating. I had to balance multiple factors - health trends, response time, prevention rate - without making any single metric dominate. I also wanted badge progression to feel achievable but rewarding."

**For Health Timeline:**
> "Managing state for the timeline scrubber and comparison mode. I needed two independent sliders that could reference the same data array, plus lazy loading the snapshots to avoid performance issues. I solved it with careful React hooks composition."

### When They Ask: "Why these features?"

> "As a fresh graduate, I wanted to demonstrate skills that go beyond CRUD operations. These features show:
> 1. Product thinking (gamification for engagement)
> 2. Complex state management (multiple sliders, tabs, modes)
> 3. Data visualization (before/after comparisons, progress bars)
> 4. Business value quantification (ROI metrics)
> 
> They're also highly visual, which makes them great for portfolio presentations."

### When They Ask: "What would you do differently?"

> "With more time, I'd add:
> - Real persistence - right now it's mock data
> - PDF export for the timeline reports
> - Social sharing for badges
> - A/B testing on the scoring algorithm
> - Animations for badge unlocks (micro-interactions)
> 
> But for a portfolio project, I focused on demonstrating core skills employers look for."

## Troubleshooting

### If Performance Dashboard Doesn't Show:
- Make sure `fetchFarmPerformanceMetrics()` succeeds
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the chip is visible in the header

### If Health Timeline Doesn't Load:
- Check that you clicked on a plant (opens modal)
- Switch to "Health Timeline" tab
- Wait for loading spinner to complete
- Verify `fetchHealthSnapshots()` is returning data

### If Photos Don't Display:
- Using picsum.photos for mock images
- Requires internet connection
- May take a moment to load
