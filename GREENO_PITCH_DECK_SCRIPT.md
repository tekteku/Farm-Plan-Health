### Slide 1: COVER
**Visual:** Greeno logo + tagline
**Text:** 
```
GREENO
Smart Farm Health Management

"Making every farmer a data scientist, one plant at a time"

[Your Name], Founder & CEO
[Date]
```

**What to say (15 sec):**
*"Good [morning/afternoon]. I'm [Your Name], and I'm here to introduce Greeno—an AI-powered platform that's helping farmers increase yields by 18% while reducing crop loss by 72%. Let me show you how we're transforming traditional farming into data-driven precision agriculture."*

---

### Slide 2: THE PROBLEM
**Visual:** Photos of diseased plants, frustrated farmer
**Text:**
```
Farmers Face Critical Challenges:

🔴 20-40% Crop Loss - Late disease detection
💰 $243+ Wasted - Reactive vs preventive treatment
⏱️ 10+ Hours/Week - Manual field inspections
📉 18% Lower Yields - Without data-driven decisions

Cost to Global Agriculture: $220 Billion Annually
```

**What to say (45 sec):**
*"Farmers are flying blind. By the time they notice yellowing leaves or wilting, it's often too late. A tomato plant at 40% health might lose $200 in harvest value. Traditional monitoring is time-consuming—walking fields daily, manually checking hundreds of plants. And without historical data, they can't tell if treatments are working. This costs the global agriculture industry $220 billion annually in preventable losses."*

---

### Slide 3: CUSTOMER PAIN POINT (Story)
**Visual:** Before/after photos of sick plant
**Text:**
```
Meet John - California Tomato Farmer

Week 1: "Some yellowing leaves... probably nothing"
Week 2: Plant at 40% health, spreading to others
Week 3: Emergency treatment costs $200
Result: Lost $800 in potential harvest

"If only I had caught it earlier..."
```

**What to say (30 sec):**
*"Let me tell you about John, a tomato farmer in California. He noticed some yellowing but thought it was normal stress. Two weeks later, the plant was at 40% health and the issue had spread to neighboring plants. Emergency treatments cost $200, and he still lost $800 in harvest value. This story repeats millions of times every season."*

```

**What to say (45 sec):**
*"Greeno solves this with four core features. First, our AI diagnosis—farmers upload a plant photo and get instant disease identification with treatment recommendations, 85-95% accurate. Second, our health timeline visually tracks each plant's journey, showing what treatments worked. Third, our performance dashboard gamifies best practices—farmers earn badges for early detection and see their ROI in real-time. Fourth, a real-time monitoring dashboard gives them a complete farm overview with color-coded health statuses. Everything works on smartphones—no expensive hardware required."*

---

### Slide 5: LIVE DEMO - AI Diagnosis
**Visual:** Actual screenshot of photo upload interface
**Text:**
```
Feature 1: AI-Powered Diagnosis

Upload → AI Analysis → Treatment Plan
Response Time: < 3 seconds

Example Output:
✓ Leaf Color: Yellow-green
✓ Disease: Nitrogen deficiency
✓ Confidence: 87%
✓ Treatment: Apply 10-10-10 fertilizer
✓ Expected Recovery: 7-10 days
```

**What to say (45 sec):**
*"Let me show you how it works. A farmer notices yellowing leaves, takes a photo on their phone, and uploads it through our interface. Within 3 seconds, our AI analyzes the image and returns a complete diagnosis: leaf color classification, disease identification—in this case nitrogen deficiency—with 87% confidence. Most importantly, it provides an actionable treatment plan: apply 10-10-10 fertilizer, expect recovery in 7-10 days. No agronomist visit required."*

---

### Slide 6: LIVE DEMO - Health Timeline
**Visual:** Timeline interface with before/after slider
**Text:**
```
Feature 2: Health Timeline Tracking

Day 0:  40% Health - Yellowing detected
Day 3:  50% Health - Fertilizer applied
Day 7:  65% Health - Improvement visible
Day 14: 90% Health - Full recovery

Visual proof that treatments work
Photos, sensor data, notes—all in one view
```

**What to say (45 sec):**
*"Here's where Greeno becomes transformational. Our health timeline shows the complete recovery story. This tomato plant started at 40% health with yellowing. After applying our recommended fertilizer, we tracked it every few days. By day 14, it recovered to 90% health. Farmers can use our before/after slider to compare photos side-by-side, see exactly what treatments were applied, and view sensor data like soil moisture and temperature. This builds confidence in data-driven decisions."*

---

### Slide 7: LIVE DEMO - Performance Dashboard
**Visual:** Dashboard with badges and ROI metrics
**Text:**
```
Feature 3: Gamification & ROI

Farm Score: 87/100 (Grade A)
Streak: 14 consecutive monitoring days

Badges Earned:
🛡️ Early Bird - Caught 3 issues early
⭐ Green Thumb - 30 days of 90%+ health
🛡️ Pest Hunter - Prevented 5 infestations

ROI This Season:
💰 $243 Saved
📈 +18% Yield
⏱️ 5.5hrs/week Efficiency
```

**What to say (45 sec):**
*"But here's the innovation that drives engagement: gamification. Farmers see their overall farm score—87 out of 100, Grade A in this case. They earn achievement badges for proactive management: Early Bird for catching issues before they're critical, Green Thumb for maintaining excellent health. Most importantly, they see their ROI in real-time: $243 saved this season, 18% yield increase, and 5.5 hours per week saved versus manual inspection. This turns farming into a game they want to win."*

## Q&A Preparation (Common Questions)

### Q: "Why won't farmers just use free YouTube videos for plant diagnosis?"
**A:** *"Great question. YouTube is reactive—you search after you have a problem. Greeno is proactive—we track health over time and alert before issues become critical. Plus, our AI gives specific confidence scores and treatment plans, not just general advice. And the timeline feature proves what works, which YouTube can't do. We're not replacing YouTube, we're providing the professional tool farmers need for their business."*

### Q: "What about competition from John Deere or other big agriculture companies?"
**A:** *"Big players like John Deere focus on machinery and large industrial farms. We're laser-focused on small-to-medium farms that can't afford $50,000 equipment. We're also significantly more agile—we can iterate in weeks, not years. If they enter our space, that validates the market and opens acquisition opportunities. Think of us as the 'Shopify of farming' while they're the 'SAP.'"*

### Q: "How accurate is your AI, really?"
**A:** *"Currently 85-95% confidence on disease identification, comparable to human agronomists. We're using established computer vision models and fine-tuning on agricultural datasets. With our seed funding, we'll integrate OpenAI's Vision API and custom training to push above 95%. But here's the key: even at 85%, we're catching issues days or weeks earlier than manual inspection, which is where the value comes from."*

### Q: "What's your customer acquisition strategy beyond the first 500?"
**A:** *"Three-pronged approach: First, partnerships with farm supply stores—they already have farmer relationships. Second, content marketing—we'll create the #1 YouTube channel for farm diagnostics, driving organic traffic. Third, referral program—we'll give farmers $50 credit for every farmer they bring in. Farmers talk to each other at markets and cooperatives—word of mouth is powerful in this community."*

### Q: "Can you show me the actual numbers—revenue per customer?"
**A:** *"Absolutely. Average customer pays $79/month on Professional tier. Annual contract value: $948. With 30-month retention, lifetime value is $2,370. We spend $150 to acquire them, so we make back acquisition cost in 2 months and have 28 months of profit. At 85% gross margin, that's $2,014 gross profit per customer. With 500 customers in Year 1, that's $474K in annual revenue, minus 35% for operating costs including my salary, marketing, and infrastructure. Net: $240K revenue with $60K loss in Year 1 as we invest in growth."*
