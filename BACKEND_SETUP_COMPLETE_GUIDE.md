## ‚ö° Quick Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Supabase Account (2 minutes)

1. Go to **https://supabase.com**
2. Click **"Start your project"**
3. Sign up with:
   - GitHub account (recommended), OR
   - Google account, OR
   - Email + password

### Step 2: Create New Project (3 minutes)

1. Click **"New Project"**
2. Fill in project details:
   ```
   Organization: Create new or select existing
   Project Name: farm-health-dashboard
   Database Password: [CREATE A STRONG PASSWORD - SAVE IT!]
   Region: Choose closest to you (e.g., East US, Europe West)
   Pricing Plan: Free (perfect for this project)
   ```

3. Click **"Create new project"**
4. ‚è±Ô∏è **Wait 2-3 minutes** for provisioning (grab coffee ‚òï)

### Step 3: Run Database Schema (2 minutes)

1. In Supabase Dashboard, click **"SQL Editor"** (left sidebar)
2. Click **"New Query"**
3. Open `supabase-schema.sql` from this project
4. **Copy the ENTIRE file** and paste into Supabase SQL Editor
5. Click **"Run"** (or press Ctrl+Enter)
6. ‚úÖ Should see: `Success. No rows returned`

**What this creates:**
- ‚úÖ 6 database tables (plants, photos, diagnoses, health_snapshots, farm_metrics, sensor_readings)
- ‚úÖ 10 sample plants with diverse health statuses
- ‚úÖ 14 health snapshots across 3 plants (showing improvement/decline patterns)
- ‚úÖ 1 farm metrics record with 8 badges and 3 achievements
- ‚úÖ All indexes and Row Level Security policies

### Step 4: Create Storage Bucket (1 minute)

1. Click **"Storage"** in left sidebar
2. Click **"Create a new bucket"**
3. Enter bucket details:
   ```
   Name: plant-photos
   Public bucket: YES (toggle ON)
   ```
4. Click **"Create bucket"**
5. ‚úÖ You should see `plant-photos` in the buckets list

### Step 5: Get Your API Credentials (1 minute)

1. Click **"Settings"** (gear icon in left sidebar)
2. Click **"API"** in settings menu
3. You'll see two important values:

   **Project URL** (looks like):
   ```
   https://abcdefghijklmnop.supabase.co
   ```

   **anon public** key (looks like):
   ```
   eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImFiY2RlZmdoaWprbG1ub3AiLCJyb2xlIjoiYW5vbiIsImlhdCI6MTYzMjE...
   ```

4. **Keep this tab open** - you'll need these in the next step!

### Step 6: Configure Environment Variables (1 minute)

1. In VS Code, create a file named `.env` in the project root
2. Copy this template and **replace with YOUR values**:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-url.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

**Example:**
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://abcdefghijklmnop.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImFiY2RlZmdoaWprbG1ub3AiLCJyb2xlIjoiYW5vbiIsImlhdCI6MTYzMjE...
```

3. **Save the file** (Ctrl+S)

## üîå Connect Your App to Supabase

Now let's switch from mock data to real database!

### Switch API Imports

I'll update 3 files to use Supabase instead of mock API:

**Files to update:**
- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/components/PlantDetail.tsx`
- `src/components/DataUpload.tsx`

**Change this line in each file:**
```typescript
import { ... } from './api/mockApi';
```

**To this:**
```typescript
import { ... } from './api/supabaseApi';
```

## ‚úÖ Test Your Backend

### 1. Restart Development Server

```powershell
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

### 2. What to Test

#### ‚úÖ Test #1: View Plants
- Open http://localhost:5173
- Should see **10 plants** in the table:
  - Tomato Plant A (healthy)
  - Corn Stalk 12 (needs-check)
  - Pepper Plant B (unhealthy)
  - Lettuce Bed 3 (healthy)
  - Strawberry 5 (needs-check)
  - Cucumber Vine C (healthy)
  - Carrot Row 7 (healthy)
  - Bean Plant 14 (needs-check)
  - Zucchini Z1 (healthy)
  - Potato Field P3 (unhealthy)

#### ‚úÖ Test #2: Health Timeline
1. Click on **"Tomato Plant A"** row
2. Click **"Health Timeline"** tab
3. Should see **6 snapshots** showing improvement:
   - 15 days ago: 40% health (unhealthy)
   - 12 days ago: 50% health (treatment applied)
   - 9 days ago: 60% health (needs-check)
   - 6 days ago: 70% health
   - 3 days ago: 80% health (healthy)
   - Now: 90% health ‚ú®
4. Use timeline scrubber to see before/after photos
5. Verify treatment notes and AI analysis appear

#### ‚úÖ Test #3: Performance Dashboard
1. Click **"Score: 87/100"** chip in header
2. Should see dashboard expand with:
   - Overall Score: **87/100**
   - Weekly Grade: **A**
   - Current Streak: **14 days**
   - **8 badges** (3 earned + 5 in progress)
   - **3 achievements** unlocked
   - ROI metrics: $243 saved, +18% yield, 5.5hrs efficiency
   - Performance insights graph

#### ‚úÖ Test #4: Photo Upload (Real Storage!)
1. Click **"Upload Photos"** button
2. Select any image from your computer
3. Drop it in the upload zone
4. Should upload to **Supabase Storage** (plant-photos bucket)
5. Check Supabase Dashboard > Storage > plant-photos to see your uploaded file!

#### ‚úÖ Test #5: Data Persistence
1. Add a new plant or update health status
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. **Data should persist** (unlike mock data that resets!)

## üóÉÔ∏è Your Database Structure

### Tables Created:

| Table | Records | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `plants` | 10 | Main plant records |
| `photos` | 0 | Photo metadata (populate by uploading) |
| `diagnoses` | 0 | AI diagnosis results |
| `health_snapshots` | 14 | Timeline data (3 plants with history) |
| `farm_metrics` | 1 | Performance dashboard data |
| `sensor_readings` | 0 | IoT sensor data (future) |

### Mock Data Highlights:

**Plant 1 (Tomato):** Complete recovery story
- 6 snapshots showing improvement from 40% ‚Üí 90% health
- Includes treatments, notes, sensor data
- Perfect for demonstrating timeline feature

**Plant 2 (Corn):** Declining health
- 4 snapshots showing decline from 85% ‚Üí 55%
- Shows need for intervention
- Good for testing alert systems

**Plant 3 (Pepper):** Critical condition
- 4 snapshots of aphid infestation
- Treatment in progress
- Demonstrates emergency response workflow

**Farm Metrics:**
- Overall score: 87/100 (Grade A)
- 3 earned badges (Early Bird, Green Thumb, Pest Hunter)
- 5 badges in progress (47%-89% completion)
- 3 achievements unlocked
- ROI: $243 saved, +18% yield

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid API key"
**Solution:** Double-check your `.env` file:
- No spaces around `=`
- URL starts with `https://`
- Key is the full long string

### Issue: "No plants showing"
**Solution:** 
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify SQL script ran successfully in Supabase
3. Check Supabase Dashboard > Table Editor > plants (should have 10 rows)

### Issue: "Photo upload fails"
**Solution:**
1. Verify bucket exists: Supabase Dashboard > Storage > plant-photos
2. Bucket must be **public**
3. Check bucket policies allow INSERT

### Issue: "Module not found" error
**Solution:** Make sure you changed imports in all 3 files:
```typescript
// Change FROM:
import { ... } from './api/mockApi';
// TO:
import { ... } from './api/supabaseApi';
```

### Issue: Timeline shows no data
**Solution:** Timeline only has data for first 3 plants (Tomato, Corn, Pepper). Click on those specifically.

## üìä Verify Data in Supabase Dashboard

### Check Tables:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **"Table Editor"** (left sidebar)
3. Select table from dropdown:

**Plants table:**
- Should show 10 rows
- Various health statuses
- Recent timestamps

**Health Snapshots table:**
- Should show 14 rows
- 6 for plant 1, 4 for plant 2, 4 for plant 3
- JSONB data in ai_analysis and sensor_data
