**Mock Data Structure:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'snap-p-001-0',
  plantId: 'p-001',
  timestamp: '2025-10-15T...',
  health: 'unhealthy',
  photoUrl: 'https://picsum.photos/...',
  aiAnalysis: {
    leafColor: 'Yellow-green',
    diseaseIndicators: ['Yellowing leaves', 'Wilting'],
    healthScore: 40,
    confidence: 85
  },
  sensorData: {
    soilMoisture: 45,
    temperature: 22,
    humidity: 60
  },
  treatment: 'Applied nitrogen-rich fertilizer',
  notes: 'Initial assessment - plant showing stress'
}
```

**Mock generates 6 snapshots per plant:**

## 🎤 Interview Soundbites

**When asked about a challenging problem:**
> "I wanted to show plant health changes over time, but static photos aren't compelling. I built a timeline scrubber with before/after comparison that calculates improvement percentages. The challenge was managing state for two separate sliders while keeping the UI performant. I solved it with React hooks and careful component composition."

**When asked about product thinking:**
> "Farmers might see health monitoring as a chore, so I added gamification. The achievement badges create intrinsic motivation, while ROI metrics justify the time investment. This is a product strategy used by companies like Duolingo and Strava to drive daily engagement."

**When asked about user experience:**
> "I prioritized progressive disclosure. The performance dashboard starts as a small chip showing just the score - low cognitive load. Curious users can click to expand and see full details. Same with the timeline - it defaults to a single view, but power users can enable compare mode for deeper analysis."
