# üöÄ Supabase Backend Setup Guide

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create Supabase Account & Project

1. **Go to Supabase**: https://supabase.com
2. **Sign up** (or log in if you have an account)
3. **Click "New Project"**
   - Organization: Select or create one
   - Name: `farm-health-dashboard` (or any name you prefer)
   - Database Password: **Save this password securely!**
   - Region: Choose closest to you
   - Pricing Plan: **Free tier is perfect for this project**
4. **Click "Create new project"** and wait ~2 minutes for setup

---

### Step 2: Run Database Schema

1. **In your Supabase dashboard**, click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
2. **Click "New query"**
3. **Copy the entire contents** of `supabase-schema.sql` from your project
4. **Paste it** into the SQL Editor
5. **Click "Run"** (or press Ctrl+Enter)
6. ‚úÖ You should see success messages like "Success. No rows returned"

**What this creates:**
- ‚úÖ 6 tables (plants, photos, diagnoses, health_snapshots, farm_metrics, sensor_readings)
- ‚úÖ Sample data (5 plants, 6 health snapshots, performance metrics)
- ‚úÖ Indexes for fast queries
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security policies
- ‚úÖ Auto-update triggers

---

### Step 3: Create Storage Bucket

1. **Click "Storage"** in the left sidebar
2. **Click "New bucket"**
3. **Bucket name**: `plant-photos`
4. **Public bucket**: ‚úÖ Check this box (so uploaded photos are accessible)
5. **Click "Create bucket"**

**Optional: Configure bucket policies**
1. Click on the `plant-photos` bucket
2. Go to "Policies" tab
3. Add policies for insert/select/update if needed (default public bucket works for demo)

---

### Step 4: Get Your API Credentials

1. **Click "Settings"** in the left sidebar (bottom)
2. **Click "API"** under Project Settings
3. **Copy these values:**
   - **Project URL** (looks like: https://xxxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co)
   - **anon public** key (long string under "Project API keys")

---

### Step 5: Configure Your Project

1. **In your project folder**, create a file called `.env` (no extension, starts with a dot)
2. **Paste this content** and replace with your actual values:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

**Example:**
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://abcdefghijk.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI...
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:**
- Never commit `.env` to Git (it's already in `.gitignore`)
- Keep your keys private

---

### Step 6: Switch to Real API

Now we need to update your code to use the real Supabase API instead of mock data.

**I'll do this for you automatically, or you can:**

1. Update imports in components:
   - Change `from './api/mockApi'` to `from './api/supabaseApi'`
   - Files to update: `App.tsx`, `DataUpload.tsx`, `PlantDetail.tsx`

---

### Step 7: Restart Development Server

1. **Stop the current server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. **Restart it:**
```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. **Open http://localhost:5173**

---

### Step 8: Test Everything

#### Test 1: View Plants
- ‚úÖ You should see 5 sample plants in the table
- ‚úÖ Click any plant to see details

#### Test 2: Upload Photos
1. Scroll to "Data Upload" section
2. Drag and drop an image (or click to select)
3. Select a plant from dropdown
4. Click "Upload & Get AI Diagnosis"
5. ‚úÖ Photos should upload to Supabase Storage
6. ‚úÖ AI diagnosis modal should open

#### Test 3: Health Timeline
1. Click any plant in the table
2. Go to "Health Timeline" tab
3. ‚úÖ You should see 6 snapshots with photos
4. ‚úÖ Use slider to navigate through time
5. ‚úÖ Click "Compare Photos" to see before/after

#### Test 4: Performance Dashboard
1. Look at header - click "Score: 87/100" chip
2. ‚úÖ Dashboard should expand showing badges and metrics
3. ‚úÖ Some badges earned, some in progress

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Invalid API key" error
**Solution:** Double-check your `.env` file has correct URL and key

### Problem: "Storage bucket not found"
**Solution:** Make sure you created the `plant-photos` bucket in Supabase Storage

### Problem: "Table does not exist"
**Solution:** Re-run the `supabase-schema.sql` in SQL Editor

### Problem: Photos not uploading
**Solution:** 
1. Check bucket is public
2. Check bucket name is exactly `plant-photos`
3. Check browser console for specific error

### Problem: No sample data showing
**Solution:** Run just the INSERT statements from `supabase-schema.sql` again

---

## Verify Your Setup

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:

```sql
-- Check plants exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM plants;
-- Should return: 5

-- Check health snapshots exist  
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM health_snapshots;
-- Should return: 6

-- Check farm metrics exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM farm_metrics;
-- Should return: 1

-- Check storage bucket
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE name = 'plant-photos';
-- Should return: 1 row
```

---

## Database Schema Overview

### Tables Created:

1. **plants** - Main plant records
2. **photos** - Photo metadata and URLs
3. **diagnoses** - AI diagnosis results
4. **health_snapshots** - Timeline data (NEW!)
5. **farm_metrics** - Performance dashboard data (NEW!)
6. **sensor_readings** - IoT sensor data

### Sample Data Inserted:

- 5 plants (various health statuses)
- 6 health snapshots for first plant (showing recovery from 40% to 90%)
- 1 farm metrics record (score 87, grade A, 8 badges, 3 achievements)

---

## Next Steps After Setup

1. ‚úÖ Test all features work with real database
2. ‚úÖ Try uploading real photos
3. ‚úÖ Add more plants using the app
4. ‚úÖ Customize sample data to match your demo scenario
5. ‚úÖ Practice your demo script

---

## Advanced: Customize Sample Data

Want to change the sample plants or metrics? Run custom SQL:

```sql
-- Add a new plant
INSERT INTO plants (name, type, health, notes) VALUES
('My Custom Plant', 'Basil', 'healthy', 'Looking great!');

-- Update farm score
UPDATE farm_metrics 
SET overall_score = 95, weekly_grade = 'A+'
WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM farm_metrics LIMIT 1);

-- Add a health snapshot
INSERT INTO health_snapshots (plant_id, timestamp, health, photo_url, ai_analysis, notes)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM plants WHERE name = 'Tomato Plant A' LIMIT 1),
  NOW(),
  'healthy',
  'https://picsum.photos/600/400',
  '{"leafColor": "Dark green", "diseaseIndicators": [], "healthScore": 95, "confidence": 98}'::jsonb,
  'Perfect conditions!'
);
```

## Security Note

For production, you should:
- [ ] Enable Row Level Security with proper policies
- [ ] Add authentication (Supabase Auth)
- [ ] Restrict bucket access to authenticated users
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Use service role key for admin operations

For portfolio/demo purposes, the current public setup is fine!
