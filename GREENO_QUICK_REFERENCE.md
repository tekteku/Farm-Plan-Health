## Objection Handling (Quick Responses)

### "Why not just Google it?"
*"Google is reactive and generic. We're proactive with AI tracking health over time, catching issues before farmers notice. Plus, we provide specific treatment plans with confidence scores, not just general advice."*

### "Farmers aren't tech-savvy."
*"70% of farmers under 40 use smartphones daily. We're targeting the generational shift. Plus, our interface is simpler than Instagram—take photo, get diagnosis. Anyone can use it."*

### "What about big competitors?"
*"John Deere focuses on large industrial farms and $50K machinery. We're the 'Shopify of farming'—affordable, accessible, for small-to-medium operations they ignore. If they enter, it validates our market."*

### "How accurate is the AI really?"
*"85-95% confidence, comparable to human agronomists. But accuracy isn't everything—we catch issues days earlier than manual inspection. Even 85% accuracy with early detection beats 100% accuracy when it's too late."*

### "Can you really monetize this?"
*"16:1 LTV to CAC ratio proves it. Farmers pay $79/month because we save them $243 per season—that's 3x ROI. We recover acquisition costs in 2 months. The economics work."*
