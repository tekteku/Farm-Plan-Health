## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Vite not recognized" error
**Solution**: Use `npx vite` instead of `npm run dev`

### Port 5173 already in use
**Solution**: Vite automatically tries port 5174. Check terminal output for correct port.

### Images not showing in AI modal
**Check**: 
1. Did you select a plant before uploading?
2. Is the console showing any errors? (F12 ‚Üí Console)
3. Try refreshing the page

### Previews not appearing
**Check**:
1. Are you selecting image files? (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
2. File size reasonable? (<10MB recommended)
3. Check browser console for errors

## üé® Customization Ideas

If you want to add your personal touch:

### Change Colors
Edit `src/theme.ts` to change primary/secondary colors

### Add Your Logo
Replace the SPA icon in the header with your own

### Customize AI Messages
Edit `diagnosisContent` in `src/components/AIDiagnosisModal.tsx`

### Add More Plants
Edit `src/data/plants.json` to add your own test data

## üìä Performance Notes

**Current Implementation**:
- Simulated 1.5s upload delay (mock API)
- Simulated 2.5s AI analysis delay
- Previews generated instantly with `URL.createObjectURL()`

**Real-World Performance** (with production setup):
- Upload: Depends on file size and network (~2-5s for 2MB image)
- AI Analysis: 1-3s with real ML service
- Preview: Instant (client-side)

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

If you have time and want to go further:

### Easy Wins (30 min - 1 hour each)
- [ ] Add file size validation (show error for >10MB)
- [ ] Add file type validation (only allow images)
- [ ] Show file names under previews
- [ ] Add "Upload Another" button after success

### Medium Difficulty (2-4 hours each)
- [ ] Image compression before upload (browser-image-compression)
- [ ] Crop tool (react-easy-crop)
- [ ] EXIF metadata extraction (exif-js)
- [ ] Local storage for offline queue

### Advanced (1-2 days each)
- [ ] Real AWS S3 integration with signed URLs
- [ ] TensorFlow.js for client-side ML
- [ ] IndexedDB offline queue with retry logic
- [ ] WebSocket for real-time upload progress

## üé§ Interview Talking Points

When discussing this feature:

### Architecture
> "I used a mock API pattern so frontend development could proceed independently. The `uploadImages()` function has a clean contract that's easy to swap with a real backend."

### UX Decisions
> "I added automatic modal triggering after upload because it reduces friction‚Äîusers don't need an extra click to see their results."

### Mobile Support
> "The `capture='environment'` attribute ensures mobile users get the rear camera by default, which is what they'd use for plant photos."

### Scalability
> "For production, I'd implement direct-to-S3 uploads using signed URLs to avoid proxying large files through the application server."

### Documentation
> "I documented the implementation thoroughly because in a team environment, other developers need to understand and extend features."
