Project Summary as of 2025-10-28
--------------------------------

Short project summary:
- Vite + React + TypeScript dashboard (Farm-Plan-Health) now includes a modern photo capture/upload experience.
- Users can drag-and-drop, capture via mobile camera, preview images, associate them with plants, and trigger a simulated AI diagnosis modal.
- Mock upload API returns placeholder URLs for local development.
- Supabase scaffolding (client, API wrappers, SQL schema, storage instructions) is ready for a production backend.

What was implemented:
- Photo upload UI with drag-and-drop, camera capture, previews, and plant selector.
- Preview gallery and ability to attach photos to plants.
- Mock upload API simulating storage with placeholder public URLs.
- AI diagnosis modal that accepts photos, shows simulated results, confidence, and recommendations.
- Plant detail view updated with a photo gallery.
- Supabase client, API wrapper functions, SQL schema, storage setup instructions, and documentation.
- Documentation suite covering feature details, quick starts, and setup guides.
- Git repository initialized, commits created, and pushed to https://github.com/tekteku/Farm-Plan-Health.

Current runtime / verification status:
- Dev server (Vite) launched successfully during development (last run served at http://localhost:5174).
- TypeScript checks passed after fixing a boolean coercion in AIDiagnosisModal.tsx.
- Automated tests and linting were not run (not present in the project).

Supabase status and required actions:
- Supabase client and API wrappers exist in src/api/.
- supabase-schema.sql defines tables, extensions, and storage instructions.
- .env.example documents required environment variables.
- To enable Supabase:
  1. Create a Supabase project at https://app.supabase.com.
  2. Run supabase-schema.sql in the Supabase SQL editor.
  3. Create a storage bucket named plant-photos (or adjust code to match a different name).
  4. Add Supabase URL and anon key to a local .env (never commit this file).
  5. Switch front-end imports from mockApi to supabaseApi and restart the dev server.

Recommended next steps:
- Switch to Supabase API and verify end-to-end uploads with real credentials.
- Add client-side image compression, EXIF handling, and per-file upload progress.
- Implement offline queueing, retry/backoff, and production-ready RLS/auth policies.
- Add automated tests (unit/integration/E2E) for upload flow and Supabase API usage.
- Integrate a real ML/AI diagnosis service if desired.

Edge cases / assumptions:
- Mobile capture depends on the browser honoring the capture attribute; some devices may differ.
- Photos currently use public URLs; use signed URLs if privacy is required.
- No client-side compression yet; large images may slow uploads or exceed quotas.

Local testing instructions:
- Install dependencies, run the Vite dev server, and use the Data Upload panel to drag files or capture photos.
- With mockApi (default), uploads return placeholder URLs and trigger the simulated AI modal.
- With Supabase enabled and supabaseApi imported, uploads go to the Supabase storage bucket and records enter the photos table.

Completion summary:
- Modern photo upload flow implemented and integrated with AI diagnosis UI and plant gallery.
- Supabase backend scaffolding and documentation delivered.
- Repository updated and pushed with all changes and guides for future work.
